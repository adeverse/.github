**Welcome to adeverse!**
 
In the ade universe, you will find a set of resources about the `ade4` R package and some other R software that use, depend on and revolve around `ade4`. 
 
In detail, you can find here the development versions of the following software:
    
- **ade4**, which contains functions for exploratory multivariate data analysis (one-table, two-tables and k-tables methods) and around a hundred data sets
- **adegraphics**, which is an S4 lattice-based package for the representation of multivariate data
- **ade4TkGUI**, which helps `ade4` users for some basic functions via a Tcl/Tk graphical interface
- **ade4shiny**, which helps `ade4` users for some basic functions via a `shiny` interface
- **adespatial**, which provides tools for the multiscale spatial analysis of multivariate data
- **adephylo**, which contains multivariate tools to analyze comparative data, i.e. a phylogeny and some traits measured for each taxa. 
 
A full description of ade4 and its scientific and software environment is available in a dedicated **website** (https://adeverse.github.io/ade4/) and **book** (https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-1-4939-8850-1).
